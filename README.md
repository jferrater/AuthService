# SecurityService
I am making my own micro services app. This is a project using Spring Boot App and Spring LDAP to store my registered users.
</br>
Objectives of this project is to create web services for the following: 
</br>
1) Registration of new user.
</br>
2) Local authentication using LDAP for registered users.
</br>
3) Login with FB and Google using OAuth2
</br>

</br>

Security Features to be implemented:
</br>
1.) OAuth2, JWT and basic authentication
</br>
